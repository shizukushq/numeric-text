# NumericText

[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@numeric-text/core.svg)](https://npmjs.com/package/@numeric-text/core)
[![Bundle Size 2.38KB](https://img.shields.io/badge/bundle_size-2.38KB-black)](https://bundlephobia.com/package/@numeric-text/core)

A lightweight, framework-agnostic component for text transitions. As the name suggests, this is a dedicated attempt to replicate the behavior and feel of SwiftUI's [.numericText](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/contenttransition/numerictext(value:)>) for the web.

## Features

- **Framework-agnostic**: Built with native Web Components. Seamlessly integrates with any library or plain HTML.
- **Zero Dependencies**: No third-party runtime dependencies.
- **Ultra-Lightweight**: Only **2.38KB** (gzipped) for the core package.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for **120fps** animations.
- **SSR Support**: Works with Server-Side Rendering.
- **A11y**:
  - **Screen Reader Ready**: Fully accessible with `aria-label` and `role="img"`.
  - **Universal**: Supports all languages and character sets via `Intl.Segmenter`.
  - **RTL Support**: Built-in support for Right-to-Left languages like Arabic or Hebrew.
  - **Respects Preferences**: Automatically disables animations for users with `prefers-reduced-motion`.

| `value`                   | `string \| number` | `""`                               | The text or number to display.                                                                                 |

| `trend`                   | `1 \| 0 \| -1`     | `0`                                | Animation direction (1: up, -1: down, 0: auto-detect based on numbers).                                        |
| `transition`              | `Transition`       | `{ duration: 550, easing: '...' }` | Custom duration and easing function.                                                                           |
| `respectMotionPreference` | `boolean`          | `true`                             | If true, disables animation for users with `prefers-reduced-motion`.                                           |

## Why?

Ever since SwiftUI introduced `.numericText`, I have been waiting for a similar solution to arrive on the web. It is an ideal way to draw a user's attention to interface changes — be it a status update, a price change, or a counter increment.

### The Limitations of Existing Solutions

Until now, the closest web alternative was [number-flow](https://number-flow.barvian.me/). While it is visually stunning and elegant, it is strictly limited to animating **numbers**. SwiftUI’s implementation, however, is much more versatile, capable of morphing arbitrary text strings.

Another approach, often referred to as "TextMorph" (popularized by components in [motion-primitives](https://motion-primitives.com/docs/text-morph)), takes a fundamentally different path. To the best of my knowledge, this technique originated in the [Family](https://family.co/) app. It works by assigning unique IDs to every character and animating their individual layout transitions.

<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5a571b3-6b61-4e31-9776-d2f1c9921cb7" autoplay loop muted playsinline style="max-width: 100%;"></video>

However, applying this specific logic to general UI text has significant drawbacks:

- **Visual Chaos**: Characters often fly across the screen in a confusing manner. During the transition from "Creative" to "Craft", letters rearrange: the fourth letter "a" moves to replace the "e", the fifth letter "t" flies to the end of "Craft", etc. It lacks a sense of structural cohesion and feels disjointed.
- **Performance Heavy**: Animating the layout of _every single character_ is expensive on lower-end mobile devices.

It is quite surprising that this "fly-everywhere" logic was so heavily promoted in [@emilkowalski](https://x.com/emilkowalski)'s [animations.dev](https://animations.dev/), considering its impact on text legibility and performance during transitions.

### The NumericText Approach

Driven by the lack of a proper SwiftUI-like alternative, I built `NumericText`. It handles both numbers and text, providing a cohesive feel for text transitions, and achieving a visual fluidity similar to [number-flow](https://number-flow.barvian.me/) when animating numbers.

Under the hood, `NumericText` uses a _LCP_ diffing algorithm. Unlike character-level morphing, this ensures the transition feels grounded and predictable. Letters don't fly randomly, they stay anchored where they belong logically.

This diffing logic is nearly identical to the one used in SwiftUI. By dividing the text into three logical sections — we only need to animate the layout transitions of the sections themselves. This approach delivers better performance, especially on low-end mobile devices.
